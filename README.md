Unfinished and pretty much light version of BIS' own Virtual Garage. Originally envisioned to be an entry to the Make Arma Not War contest, I've pretty much abandoned this altogether.

## (Planned) Functionality

View, edit, and test all vehicles Arma 3 has to offer, including full mod support.
Provide a pretty UI to do it all.

^Identical to BIS Garage.
